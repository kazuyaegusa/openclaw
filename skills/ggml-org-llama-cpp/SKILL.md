# Ggml Org Llama Cpp

The main goal of `llama.cpp` is to enable LLM inference with minimal setup and state-of-the-art performance on a wide
range of hardware - locally and in the cloud.

- Plain C/C++ implementation without any dependencies
- Apple silicon is a first-class citizen - optimized via ARM NEON, Accelerate and Metal frameworks
- AVX, AVX2, AVX512 and AMX support for x86 architectures
- RVV, ZVFH, ZFH, ZICBOP and ZIHINTPAUSE support for RISC-V architectures
- 1.5-bit, 2-bit, 3-bit, 4-bit, 5-bit, 6-bit, and
